    <h2>the man himself</h2>

    <p>Alan Turing was born June 23rd, 1912. He supposedly began theorizing about quantum mechanics and the like before even applying for schools.</p>

    <p>After completing college, Turing created the Turing machine, which some believe to be the first modern computer. I personally do not understand how it works so I can't really explain it, so here's a website that can: http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Turing_machine

    <p> Turing spent much of his time working on cracking the german "Enigma Code," which was typically used in naval communication at the time, and also happened to be considered "unbreakable." He was able to decrypt it, and it began regular use in decyphering German communication during mid-1941.</p>
   
    <p> Turing also dedicated much of his time to discussions about whether or not a machine be considered sentient. He devised the "Turing Test." It entails an interrogator asking a human and a machine questions in isolation, and seeing if you could differentiate between the two. If you can not, the machine is intelligent. </p>
